    "  Microsoft's is looking to expand it's footprint outside of their core lines of business, and start a new business unit focused on the entertainment industry specifically, producing movies. The goal of the project at hand, was to analyze movie data in order to provide insights for this new BU. The analysis provided answers some of the main points of consideration for such a business venture to be successful, namely, when to release a prospective film, which genre's to produce, and which studios to use, all in an attempt to generate the highest rate of return for Microsoft and their clients."

Without being able to turn a profit, it is unlikely Microsoft will want to continue to compete in the entertainment industry if it means losing money every quarter. In order to maximize profitabilty potential, we need to consider the most influential variables that contribute to profitabilty. With this in mind, we investigate the following three main questions:\n",
    "1. What Genres are most succesful in terms of return on investment (ROI)\n",
    "2. Which months are lead to highest viewer participation and ROI?\n",
    "3. Which Studio has a track record of producing high grossing and ROI films?\n",

    "The intent of this question was to analyze months in which it is beneficial or detrimental to release a film from a profitability and viewership perspective. The two main data sets used here were budgets (tn.movie_budgets) and audience related (tmdb.movies). Budgets is used again here as the target variable for most of our analysis was to optimize ROI, while our audience related data provided us with vote_count, popularity, and vote_average from which we can derive viewer engagement. Our new data table needed to be cleaned for duplicate entries and both tables converted release_date column to datetime. Both tables were used to create their own groupby with mean, median, and count aggregates so they both could be plotted based of each tables respective as we lost nearly 80-90% of data on by joining. A dataframe was made for large budget movies that were 1 std away from the median value of production budgets.\n"

The studio data required cleaning of Na values and converting column datatypes using a map lambda function. When joined with our budget data we grouped our data by studio and filtered for studios that have made more than 10 movies as we are only interested in using established movie studios. Lastly, a new column was made to classify budget range using a map lambda function. This allowed us to view studios success given varying sets of budget constraints  "
